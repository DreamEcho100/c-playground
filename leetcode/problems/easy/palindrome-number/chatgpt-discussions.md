## Problem Statement Explained in Simple Terms

*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
Yea, I saw someone doing that

```c
bool isPalindrome(int x){
    if(x<0 || x!=0 && x%10 ==0 ) return false;
    int check=0;
    while(x>check){
        check = check*10 + x%10;
        x/=10;
    }
    return (x==check || x==check/10);
}
```

But I can't seem too comprehend it as someone coming from JS and math is not his strongest suit :P, please explain it to me in detail

Absolutely, let's break this down step by step in a simple and visual way, assuming you're coming from a JavaScript mindset and math isn't your favorite thing. We'll build the explanation piece by piece, just like debugging in JS. ðŸ˜Š

### Problem in Simple Terms

We're checking if a number is the same when read forward and backward.

Example:

- `121` is a palindrome: forward: `121`, backward: `121`
- `123` is not a palindrome: forward: `123`, backward: `321`

But instead of turning the number into a string or array (like we'd do in JS), we'll work **directly with the digits** of the number using **math**.

---

### Key Observations

1. **Negative Numbers Can't Be Palindromes**:
   - They start with a `-` sign. E.g., `-121` isn't the same backward (`121-`).
   - Check: `if (x < 0)` return `false`.

2. **Numbers Ending in 0 (Except 0 Itself)**:
   - A number like `10` can't be a palindrome, because forward it's `10`, backward it's `01`.
   - Check: `if (x != 0 && x % 10 == 0)` return `false`.

---

### Core Logic: Reversing the Second Half

Now, let's visualize how the function reverses the second half of the number while keeping the first half intact.

---

#### Example 1: `121`

- Start with `x = 121` and `check = 0`.
- The `while` loop runs **until `x <= check`**, because once we process half the digits, we're done.

| Step | `x`  | Last Digit (`x % 10`) | `check` (Reversed Half) | Remaining (`x / 10`) |
|------|-------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1    | 121   | 1                      | `0 * 10 + 1 = 1`        | `121 / 10 = 12`      |
| 2    | 12    | 2                      | `1 * 10 + 2 = 12`       | `12 / 10 = 1`        |

At this point, `x = 1` and `check = 12`. The loop stops because `x <= check`.

---

#### Final Check for `121`

- If the number has an **even number of digits**:
  - We compare `x` with `check`.
- If the number has an **odd number of digits**:
  - The middle digit doesn't matter, so we compare `x` with `check / 10`.

For `121`:

- `x == check / 10` â†’ `1 == 12 / 10` â†’ `1 == 1` â†’ `true`.

---

### Example 2: `12321`

Let's go step by step again.

| Step | `x`  | Last Digit (`x % 10`) | `check` (Reversed Half) | Remaining (`x / 10`) |
|------|-------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1    | 12321 | 1                      | `0 * 10 + 1 = 1`        | `12321 / 10 = 1232`  |
| 2    | 1232  | 2                      | `1 * 10 + 2 = 12`       | `1232 / 10 = 123`    |
| 3    | 123   | 3                      | `12 * 10 + 3 = 123`     | `123 / 10 = 12`      |

At this point, `x = 12` and `check = 123`. The loop stops because `x <= check`.

---

#### Final Check for `12321`

- The number has an **odd number of digits**, so we compare `x` with `check / 10`.
- `x == check / 10` â†’ `12 == 123 / 10` â†’ `12 == 12` â†’ `true`.

---

### Why This Works

1. **Reversing the Second Half**:
   - Instead of reversing the whole number (like you'd do in JS), we only reverse half. This reduces unnecessary work.

2. **Efficiently Halting the Loop**:
   - The loop stops as soon as we've processed half the digits, so we don't waste time on the rest.

3. **Odd vs. Even Digits**:
   - By dividing `check` by 10 in the odd-digit case, we ignore the middle digit.

---

### Side-by-Side Comparison with JS

Here's the equivalent JS logic for clarity:

```javascript
function isPalindrome(x) {
  if (x < 0 || (x !== 0 && x % 10 === 0)) return false;

  let check = 0;
  while (x > check) {
    check = check * 10 + (x % 10); // Reverse last digit of x into check
    x = Math.floor(x / 10);       // Remove last digit from x
  }

  return x === check || x === Math.floor(check / 10);
}
```

---

### Key Takeaways for You

- **Breaking Numbers into Digits**:
  - Use `%` to extract the last digit: `x % 10`.
  - Use `/` to remove the last digit: `x / 10`.

- **Reversing**:
  - Use `reversed = reversed * 10 + last_digit` to build the reversed number.

- **Stopping Condition**:
  - Stop when `x <= check`, because that means you've processed half the number.
