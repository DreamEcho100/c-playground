## Prompt

What do you think, I first tried to make it with a hash map but I realized I did't need it

```c
/**

* 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
* Easy
* Topics
* Companies
* Hint
* Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
*
* Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
*
* Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
* Return k.
* Custom Judge:
*
* The judge will test your solution with the following code:
*
* int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
* int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length
*
* int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation
*
* assert k == expectedNums.length;
* for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
*     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
* }
* If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
*
*
*
* Example 1:
*
* Input: nums = [1,1,2]
* Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
* Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
* It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
* Example 2:
*
* Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
* Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
* Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
* It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
*
*
* Constraints:
*
* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
* -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
* nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Response

Your approach is solid, and you were right to realize that a hash map isn't necessary. Since the array is already sorted, you can efficiently remove duplicates in-place using a **two-pointer technique**.

### Things You Did Well

âœ… **Efficient Approach**  
Your solution runs in **O(n)** time complexity, which is optimal for this problem. It keeps track of unique elements in-place without extra memory usage (apart from a few variables).

âœ… **Correct Edge Case Handling**  
You correctly handle cases where the array is empty (`numsSize == 0`) or has only one element (`numsSize == 1`).

âœ… **In-Place Modification**  
You're modifying `nums` in place without using extra memory, which is the intended solution.

### Issues & Improvements

1. **Unnecessary Second Loop (`i = non_unique_elem_size; for (+1; i < numsSize; i++)`)**

    * This loop attempts to set the remaining elements to `0`, but the problem statement **doesn't require this**.
    * The judge only checks the first `k` elements, so this step is unnecessary.
    * Removing it makes the function cleaner and avoids modifying elements that don't need to be changed.
2. **Variable Naming**

    * `non_unique_elem_size` is a bit misleading. A better name would be `uniqueCount`, `k`, or `writeIndex`.
3. **Minor Formatting Issue in `for` Loop (`for (+1; i < numsSize; i++)`)**

    * The `+1;` is unnecessary and causes a syntax error.

---

### Improved Version

Hereâ€™s a cleaner, slightly optimized version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int removeDuplicates(int *nums, int numsSize)
{
    if (numsSize == 0)
    {
        return 0;
    }

    int uniqueCount = 1; // Tracks the index where the next unique element should be placed

    for (int i = 1; i < numsSize; i++)
    {
        if (nums[i] != nums[uniqueCount - 1]) // If it's a new unique number
        {
            nums[uniqueCount] = nums[i];
            uniqueCount++;
        }
    }

    return uniqueCount;
}
```

---

### Key Fixes

âœ… Removed the unnecessary second loop.  
âœ… Renamed `non_unique_elem_size` to `uniqueCount` for clarity.  
âœ… Fixed the `for (+1; i < numsSize; i++)` syntax issue.  
âœ… Simplified the logic while keeping the same **O(n)** time complexity.

### Test Cases

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void printArray(int *nums, int size)
{
    printf("[");
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
        printf("%d", nums[i]);
        if (i < size - 1)
            printf(", ");
    }
    printf("]\n");
}

int main()
{
    int nums1[] = {1, 1, 2};
    int size1 = sizeof(nums1) / sizeof(nums1[0]);
    int k1 = removeDuplicates(nums1, size1);
    printf("k = %d, nums = ", k1);
    printArray(nums1, k1);

    int nums2[] = {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4};
    int size2 = sizeof(nums2) / sizeof(nums2[0]);
    int k2 = removeDuplicates(nums2, size2);
    printf("k = %d, nums = ", k2);
    printArray(nums2, k2);

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Output

```c
k = 2, nums = [1, 2]
k = 5, nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

This ensures that only the first `k` elements matter while leaving the rest of the array as-is.

---

### Final Thoughts

Your initial approach was already **efficient and correct**, just needed some **minor cleanups**! Great job catching that a hash map wasnâ€™t neededâ€”it shows you're thinking about **algorithmic efficiency**. ðŸš€
