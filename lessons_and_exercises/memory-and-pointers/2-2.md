No worriesâ€”let's break this down carefully, especially focusing on **Exercise 3**, which is admittedly the trickiest because it deals with **pointer-to-pointer concepts**.

### What Exercise 3 Is About

In this exercise, you're working with **pointer-to-pointer** mechanics, meaning a pointer that points to another pointer. The goal is to:

1. Allocate memory dynamically on the **heap** for an integer.
2. Assign this newly allocated memory address to the **pointer being pointed to** by the `pointer-to-pointer`.
3. Modify the value at this newly allocated memory location.

### Why This Is Useful

This type of code is used to indirectly modify a pointer variable outside of the current function's scope. It's a common pattern in situations where you need to pass around dynamically allocated resources.

### Let's Fix Exercise 3

I'll rewrite the function step-by-step and add explanations.

#### Corrected Version of Exercise 3

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to allocate memory and set the value via a pointer-to-pointer
void allocate_int(int **pointer_to_pointer, int value) {
    // Step 1: Allocate memory for an integer on the heap.
    int *heap_memory = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (heap_memory == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed!\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Step 2: Store the value in the allocated memory.
    *heap_memory = value;

    // Step 3: Update the pointer that pointer_to_pointer is pointing to.
    *pointer_to_pointer = heap_memory;
}
```

---

#### Testing `allocate_int` in `main`

Here's how you would test it in the main function:

```c
int main() {
    int *number = NULL; // Step 1: Declare a pointer initialized to NULL.

    // Step 2: Call allocate_int, passing the address of the pointer and a value.
    allocate_int(&number, 42);

    // Step 3: Print the value stored at the allocated memory.
    printf("Value allocated on the heap: %d\n", *number);

    // Step 4: Free the allocated memory.
    free(number);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Every Step

1. **In `allocate_int`:**
   - **`int *heap_memory = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));`**
     - Dynamically allocates memory for a single integer.
     - Returns a pointer (`heap_memory`) to the allocated block.

   - **`*heap_memory = value;`**
     - Dereferences the `heap_memory` pointer and assigns the value to the allocated memory.

   - **`*pointer_to_pointer = heap_memory;`**
     - Dereferences the `pointer_to-pointer` (i.e., modifies what it points to) and assigns the address of `heap_memory`.

2. **In `main`:**
   - **`int *number = NULL;`**
     - Starts with a pointer pointing to nothing.

   - **`allocate_int(&number, 42);`**
     - Passes the address of `number` so that the function can modify the `number` pointer to point to the allocated memory.

   - **`printf("%d", *number);`**
     - Dereferences `number` to print the value stored in the dynamically allocated memory.

   - **`free(number);`**
     - Frees the memory to avoid a memory leak.

### Visualizing Pointer-to-Pointer Mechanics

#### Before the Function Call

| Variable Name     | Points To       | Value at Memory  |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| `number`          | `NULL`          | None             |
| `pointer_to_pointer` | `&number`      | Address of `number` |

#### Inside `allocate_int`

1. **Memory Allocation (`heap_memory`)**
   - New memory is allocated on the heap. Let's say it's at address `0x1000`.
   - The value `42` is stored there.

   | Variable Name   | Points To  | Value at Memory |
   |------------------|------------|-----------------|
   | `heap_memory`   | `0x1000`   | `42`            |

2. **Updating `pointer_to_pointer`:**
   - `*pointer_to_pointer = heap_memory;`
   - Updates `number` to point to `0x1000`.

   | Variable Name     | Points To   | Value at Memory  |
   |--------------------|-------------|------------------|
   | `number`          | `0x1000`    | `42`             |
   | `pointer_to_pointer` | `&number` | Address of `number` |

### Exercise 3 Breakdown as Steps

#### Step 1: Create a pointer-to-pointer function

Write a function that:

1. Accepts a pointer-to-pointer as an argument.
2. Allocates memory dynamically using `malloc`.
3. Updates the pointer that the `pointer-to-pointer` points to.

#### Step 2: Test It in Main

1. Declare a pointer initialized to `NULL`.
2. Pass the pointer's address (`&pointer`) to your function.
3. Print the value stored in the newly allocated memory.
4. Free the memory to avoid memory leaks.

### Homework

Now it's time for **you** to try writing or fixing Exercise 3!

Here's your task:

1. Implement a pointer-to-pointer function named `allocate_double` to allocate memory for a `double` type and set its value.
2. Write a `main` function to test it.

Example prototype:

```c
void allocate_double(double **pointer_to_pointer, double value);
```
