# Comprehensive Guide to Memory, Pointers, `malloc`, and `free` in C

## Part 1: Understanding Memory

### Memory in C

In a C program, memory is divided into several segments:

1. **Code Segment**: Where the compiled program instructions live.
2. **Stack**: Stores function calls, local variables, and return addresses. Memory is automatically managed here.
3. **Heap**: Memory allocated dynamically by the programmer using functions like `malloc`. You must manage this memory manually.
4. **Global/Static Segment**: Stores global and static variables.

Here's a diagram of memory:

```terminal
|--------------------------|
|   Code Segment           |
|--------------------------|
|   Global/Static Segment  |
|--------------------------|
|   Heap (grows upward)    |
|--------------------------|
|   Stack (grows downward) |
|--------------------------|
```

### Visualizing Stack and Heap

- The **stack** is for temporary, short-lived memory (e.g., function calls).
- The **heap** is for longer-lived memory that you explicitly allocate and deallocate.

### Key Differences

| Feature         | Stack                   | Heap                    |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Size**        | Limited, small         | Large, dependent on system |
| **Allocation**  | Automatic              | Manual via `malloc`/`free` |
| **Lifetime**    | Function-specific      | Until `free` is called |
| **Speed**       | Fast                   | Slower |

## Part 2: Pointers Explained

### What Is a Pointer?

A pointer is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable. Think of it as a map to a treasure chest.

```c
int a = 42;        // A normal integer variable
int *ptr = &a;     // A pointer to the address of 'a'
```

Here's how memory looks:

```terminal
Variable:    Address    Value
  a          0x1000     42
  ptr        0x2000     0x1000 (address of 'a')
```

### Pointer Operations

- `&` (Address-of): Gives the memory address of a variable.
- `*` (Dereference): Accesses the value stored at the pointer's address.

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int *ptr = &a;

    printf("Value of a: %d\n", *ptr);    // Dereference to get the value
    printf("Address of a: %p\n", ptr);  // Print address stored in the pointer

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```terminal
Value of a: 10
Address of a: 0x7ffeeabc1234
```

### Pointer to Pointer

A **pointer-to-pointer** stores the address of another pointer.

```c
int a = 5;
int *ptr = &a;
int **ptr_ptr = &ptr;
```

Here's how memory looks:

```terminal
Variable:    Address    Value
  a          0x1000     5
  ptr        0x2000     0x1000
  ptr_ptr    0x3000     0x2000
```

## Part 3: Dynamic Memory Allocation (`malloc` and `free`)

### What Is `malloc`?

`malloc` (memory allocation) allocates memory on the **heap** at runtime. It returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *arr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // Allocates memory for 5 integers
    if (arr == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        arr[i] = i * 10;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", i, arr[i]);
    }

    free(arr); // Frees the allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```

### Memory Flow

1. Call `malloc` to allocate memory.
2. Use the allocated memory.
3. Call `free` to deallocate.

### Common Mistakes

- **Forgetting `free`**: Leads to memory leaks.
- **Using Freed Memory**: Leads to undefined behavior.

#### Example of Dangling Pointer

```c
int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
free(ptr);
*ptr = 42; // Dangerous! Accessing freed memory
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Pointer Operations

Write a program that:

1. Declares an integer variable.
2. Declares a pointer to the variable.
3. Prints the address and value using the pointer.

### Exercise 2: Allocating and Freeing Memory

Write a program that:

1. Allocates memory for an array of 10 integers using `malloc`.
2. Fills the array with the squares of the index (0, 1, 4, 9, ...).
3. Prints the values.
4. Frees the memory.

### Exercise 3: Pointer-to-Pointer

Write a function `allocate_int` that:

1. Accepts a pointer-to-pointer to an integer.
2. Allocates memory for an integer on the heap.
3. Sets the integer to a value passed in as a parameter.

Test it by:

1. Declaring an integer pointer in `main`.
2. Passing its address to `allocate_int`.
3. Printing the value.

### Exercise 4: Debugging Memory Errors

Here's a buggy program:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *ptr = 10;
    free(ptr);
    *ptr = 20; // Buggy: Using freed memory

    return 0;
}
```

Fix the issues.
