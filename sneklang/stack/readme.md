munit_case(RUN, pop_stack, {

int main() {
  MunitTest tests[] = {
      munit_test("/create_stack", create_stack),
      munit_test("/push_stack", push_stack),
      munit_test("/pop_stack", pop_stack),
      munit_null_test,
  };

  MunitSuite suite = munit_suite("snekstack", tests);

  return munit_suite_main(&suite, NULL, 0, NULL);
}
```

Why this works and this:

```c
void stack_free(stack_t *stack)
{
 if (stack == NULL)
 {
  return;
 }

 if (stack->data == NULL)
 {
  free(stack);
  return;
 }

 for (size_t i = 0; i < stack->count; ++i)
 {
  free(stack->data[i]);
 }

 free(stack->data);
 free(stack);
}
```

Results to:

```
snekstack/create_stack               [ OK    ]
Error: main.c:64: assertion failed: boot_all_freed()
snekstack/push_stack                 [ FAIL  ]
snekstack/pop_stack                  [ OK    ]
2 of 3 (67%) tests successful, 0 (0%) test skipped.results to
```

The issue arises because your `stack_free` function tries to free each element in `stack->data` using the following loop:

```c
for (size_t i = 0; i < stack->count; ++i)
{
    free(stack->data[i]);
}
``` **Why does this fail?**

The test cases use stack elements (`&one`, `&two`, `&three`) that are **pointers to stack variables** (not dynamically allocated memory). These pointers are not allocated on the heap, so attempting to `free()` them results in **undefined behavior**, leading to the test failure or runtime errors.

---

## **Key Observations**

1. **Not All Pointers Need to Be Freed**:
   - The test cases pass stack elements that are pointers to local variables (e.g., `&one`, `&two`), which are not dynamically allocated. Since these aren't allocated on the heap, calling `free()` on them is incorrect and causes the program to fail.

2. **Expected Behavior in `stack_free`**:
   - Per the test case requirements, `stack_free` assumes that **all elements inside `stack->data` are already freed**, so you should not attempt to free them yourself in `stack_free`.

3. **The Correct `stack_free` Implementation**:
   - Simply free `stack->data` and `stack`, as you are only responsible for managing the memory you explicitly allocated.

---

## **Correct `stack_free` Implementation**

```c
void stack_free(stack_t *stack)
{
    if (stack == NULL)
    {
        return;
    }

    if (stack->data != NULL)
    {
        free(stack->data); // Free the dynamically allocated data array
    }

    free(stack); // Free the stack structure itself
}
```

---

## **Why Does This Work?**

This implementation aligns with the requirements:

- The test framework assumes that the caller (in this case, the test case itself) manages the memory of the stack's elements. For example:
  - `stack_push(s, &one);` pushes the address of a stack variable (`one`), so freeing it in `stack_free` is inappropriate.
- The `stack_free` function only frees the resources it owns:
  - The `stack->data` array.
  - The `stack` structure itself.

This avoids attempting to free memory not allocated by the `stack` implementation.

---

## **What About `boot_all_freed()`?**

The `boot_all_freed()` assertion checks whether all dynamically allocated memory in the program has been properly freed. If your `stack_free` attempts to `free()` memory it does not own (e.g., pointers to stack variables), it can lead to undefined behavior, which may confuse `boot_all_freed()`.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- Only free memory that your code explicitly allocates (e.g., via `malloc`).
- Do not attempt to `free()` stack variables or pointers unless you're responsible for their allocation.
- The `stack_free` function should handle freeing the stack's internal resources, but it should not attempt to free the elements inside `stack->data` unless explicitly stated otherwise.
