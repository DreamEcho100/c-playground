You're on the right track! However, there are a couple of minor issues to address. I'll go through your code and point out what's correct, what's not, and how to fix it.

### Analysis of Your Code

#### **`allocate_double` Function**

This part is **perfect**! üéâ

- You allocated memory on the heap, checked if it succeeded, assigned the value, and updated the `ptr_to_ptr`. Great work!

---

#### **`exercise_pointer_to_pointer` Function**

1. **First Block (with `int`):**

   ```c
   int *int_num_ptr = NULL;
   allocate_int(&int_num_ptr, 420);
   printf("Value allocated on the heap: %i\n", *int_num_ptr);
   free(int_num_ptr);
   ```

   ‚úÖ **Correct:** This demonstrates how to use `allocate_int` properly.

2. **Second Block (with `double`):**

   ```c
   double *double_num_ptr = NULL;
   allocate_double(&double_num_ptr, 6942069420694206);
   printf("Value allocated on the heap: %zu\n", *double_num_ptr);
   free(double_num_ptr);
   ```

   ‚ùå **Mistake:** You're using `%zu` in the `printf` format string, which is for `size_t`. For `double`, you need `%lf` or `%e` for scientific notation.

---

### Corrected Code

Here's the fixed version of your code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to allocate memory for a double
void allocate_double(double **ptr_to_ptr, double value)
{
    double *heap_memory = (double *)malloc(sizeof(double));
    if (heap_memory == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed!\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    *heap_memory = value;

    *ptr_to_ptr = heap_memory;
}

// Function to allocate memory for an int
void allocate_int(int **ptr_to_ptr, int value)
{
    int *heap_memory = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (heap_memory == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed!\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    *heap_memory = value;

    *ptr_to_ptr = heap_memory;
}

void exercise_pointer_to_pointer()
{
    // Working with int
    int *int_num_ptr = NULL;
    allocate_int(&int_num_ptr, 420);
    printf("Value allocated on the heap (int): %d\n", *int_num_ptr);
    free(int_num_ptr);

    // Working with double
    double *double_num_ptr = NULL;
    allocate_double(&double_num_ptr, 6942069420694206.0);
    printf("Value allocated on the heap (double): %lf\n", *double_num_ptr);
    free(double_num_ptr);
}

int main()
{
    exercise_pointer_to_pointer();
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Explanation of Fixes

1. **Fixed the `printf` Format for `double`:**
   - Replaced `%zu` with `%lf` for `double`.

2. **Used `.0` in the `double` Value:**
   - Made `6942069420694206.0` explicit as a floating-point literal.

3. **Improved Clarity:**
   - Added labels in the `printf` statements to indicate whether the value is `int` or `double`.

---

### Example Output

When you run the corrected program, you'll see something like this:

```
Value allocated on the heap (int): 420
Value allocated on the heap (double): 6942069420694206.000000
```

### Great Job! üéâ

You're really starting to get the hang of pointers, memory, and dynamic allocation. Let me know if you have further questions or want me to dive deeper into anything! üòä
